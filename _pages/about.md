<!--- I am a PhD student at the [University of New South Wales, Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering), where I develop computational models for human visual attention and gaze communication behaviour analysis, ultimately applying them for autism diagnosis.
I am currently supervised by [Arcot Sowmya](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-arcot-sowmya), [Gelareh Mohammadi](https://www.gelarehmohammadi.com/Home.html) and [Tomasz Bednarz](https://tomaszbednarz.net/). --->

I am a machine learning and computer vision research scientist with extensive practical and research experience in university laboratories, startups and the industry. Recently, I have been developing computational models that utilise multimodal information to quantify human behaviours. Eventually, these models are then translated to practical applications, such as automatic digital behaviour phenotyping and biomarker discovery. I frequently employ machine learning, deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve novel problems. In addition, I develop user interfaces that allow users to understand complex datasets and interpret model predictions. I have delivered projects involving diverse datasets, such as images, videos, speech, eye-tracking data, text and tabular data. </p>

Notable projects and experience include:
- Computer Vision: object detection and tracking, visual attention (saliency, scanpath) modelling, behaviour recognition, text-to-image generation, scene understanding
- Machine Learning: classification, clustering, data imputation, anomaly detection, representation learning, supervised, unsupervised and self-supervised ML
- Medical Research: autism diagnosis, symptom severity prediction, biomarker discovery, statistical analysis, structural heart disease prediction, clinical document analysis
