I am a PhD student at the [University of New South Wales, Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering), where I develop computational models for human visual attention and gaze communication behaviour analysis, ultimately applying them for autism diagnosis.
I am currently supervised by[Arcot Sowmya](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-arcot-sowmya), [Gelareh Mohammadi](https://www.gelarehmohammadi.com/Home.html) and [Tomasz Bednarz](https://tomaszbednarz.net/).
